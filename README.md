# AutoHotkey-Scripts
 Folder of my scripts. For version control?
 
 ScriptFag.ahk is a script that I use to host smaller pieces of code.<br />
 Boxy.ahk is a snipping tool.<br />
 YoutubeDL/YTDL_HelperGui.ahk is a simple host for youtube-dl.exe. [Youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl)
 
 Made for 2560x1440 monitors and my system. :)<br />
 No guarantee these will work at all. 
 
 Run BuildIncludes.ahk before using
